Hey blogosphere!

My name's Jake Knigge and this blog's name is Eggink Blog. It's a place to ink-up (or markdown) some (quasi) egghead-ed topics from statistics, machine learning, mathematics, 
computer science and physics.

Anyways, here's a little bit about me...

I am a Nebraska-native turned Colorado-convert since 2001. 
I graduated from the University of Colorado in 2013 after studying quantitative finance.
I worked at Deloitte for a couple of years following college as a consultant.
In 2014, Angela and I got married. It was a heckuva a party.
I changed jobs in 2015 and started working for CoBank, an agricultural lender, in Denver, Colorado. This my current working home.

Some of my hobbies are...

* snowboarding with Angela, 
* using quantitative tools to tell stories and solve problems, 
* trying to understand the world through the “languages” of math and science, 
* trying to understand languages (Italian, German, and French),
* trail running with Maya (and Angela and Raven, when they'll partake),
* reading,
* learning and understanding the learning process, 
* meditating and stretching (*i.e.*, "yoga-ing"),
* listening to music,
* playing guitar, banjo, and mandolin.

I have a traditional website that lives [here][knigge-us].
